# T.C.S-Torrent-Caching-System


#Installation:

    Edit the following files with the database infos:
    dbconfig.php    //is the config file for most files
    search.php      //duhh
    totaltrrs.php    //counts the number of strings added inside of the database 


    once done, import the sql.sql inside of your DB, add the files inside of the server,
    set up a cron job as often as possible with the host of your website & 
    you're good to go (i used cron-job.org for the cron, they're good, give 
    them a beer as they deserve it :P).

#Disclaimer:

    The creator of this script cannot be held responsible for the work it does 
    & how the way this script's downloaders use it, the script only caches the 
    torrents encoded/repacked or published by people around the world, it does 
    not store torrents on the server & it neither provides for torrent 
    download links.

    What Ever Happens Once The User Downloads This Script It Is His/Her Own Responsibility.

#About The Script:

    * The Script Was Designed To Run As Smoothly As Possible
    * It Doesn't Need Any Kind Of 3rd Party Framework To Work, it is An Independed Script,
    * It Works Alright With TorrentTrader (as Most Websites Run TorrentTrader For Their Torrent System)
    * As I Recently Tried To Migrate It & In Conclusion It Might Work better With The Versions Who Don't Save The Torrent Files On Their Own Server But Those Who Use Sites Like Torcache Or Similar Sites (i Honestly Havn't Tried It With Those Versions, But I Doubt That It'll Do The Job)
    * The Current Version Indexes Only Extratorrent's Torrents, I'll Add TPB Soon!!
    * The Pornography Sections Are Not Indexed On This Version, But Those Who'll Get The Source Code Can Re-Add Them Manually The Indexing Of Those Torrents (they're Nothing But Trouble Lol)!!
